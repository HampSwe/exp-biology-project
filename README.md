# ga-data-processing
The data and programs used for processing and visualizing the results of my "gymnasiearbete" (final high school project, shortened as GA) in Experimental Biology.

WARNING: This code is so similar to spaghetti that one might think that it's made in Italy (even though it's gracefully written in Swenglish). Now, there could only be two reasons to why you're reading this:

1: You have stumbled upon here by accident. If that is the case, there is probably nothing of value to you here.

2: You have found my GA in the Legendary Book Of GA's at the Department of Experimental Biology. You are just curious - or, perhaps, you want to use the method that I developed in your own GA. If that is the case, I do not take ANY accountability for the severe headache that you most likely will endure while reading this code. With that said, I wish you the best of luck with your GA! 

On a more serious note: if you actually are thinking of implementing my method for being able to, given a homogenous solution consisting of multiple known solutions of unknown concentration, quantify the concentrations of the respective solutions using spectroscopy - or just think our visualizations look cool and want to use them for other data - feel free to message me on Github and I will be glad to help you out!

If you want more details on how the project works, start by reading the final report located in the "reports" folder (note: written in Swedish). Thereafter, inspect the program called "regression.py" located in the "study-2" folder.
